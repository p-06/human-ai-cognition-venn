# human-ai-cognition-venn
Python script for generating a Venn diagram comparing human and AI cognition for academic research.
## Overview

This repository contains a Python script that generates a Venn diagram comparing key traits of human and AI cognition.  
The visualization is designed to support academic research in cognitive boundaries, ethical AI frameworks, and labor economics.

## Features

- Highlights unique and shared cognitive traits
- Uses `matplotlib_venn` for clear visual representation
- Suitable for inclusion in papers, presentations, and teaching materials

## How to Use

Run `cognition_venn.py` in a Python environment with `matplotlib` and `matplotlib_venn` installed.  
The script will generate and save a PNG image titled `human_vs_ai_cognition.png`.
